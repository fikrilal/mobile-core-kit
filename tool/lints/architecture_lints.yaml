# Architecture import boundaries (custom_lint).
#
# This file is the single source of truth for architecture import rules:
# - IDE linting via `custom_lint`
# - CLI/CI checks via `dart run custom_lint` (wired into tool/verify.dart)
#
# Patterns are POSIX globs, relative to the repository root (use `/`).
