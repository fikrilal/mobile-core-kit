# Technical Debt Tracker

Use this file to track follow-up work that was intentionally deferred from completed plans.

## Rules

1. Each debt item links to its source plan in `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.
2. Keep entries concrete and actionable.
3. Remove entries when completed (do not leave stale closed rows).

## Debt Items

| ID | Date | Source plan | Item | Impact | Priority | Owner | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEBT-001 | YYYY-MM-DD | `docs/exec-plans/completed/<file>.md` | <describe debt> | <area> | P1/P2/P3 | <name> | <date> |
