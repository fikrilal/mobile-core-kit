# Explainers

Deep dives on “how this works” (not day-to-day patterns and not cross-team contracts).

Suggested structure:

- `docs/explainers/features/<feature_name>/...` — feature internals (complex animations, tricky screens, non-obvious flows).
- `docs/explainers/core/...` — deep dives on core subsystems when the detail doesn’t fit `docs/engineering/`.
- `docs/explainers/core/architecture/...` — architecture deep dives (e.g. Dependency Inversion, port/adapter patterns).
- `docs/explainers/core/push/...` — push-related deep dives (FCM token sync, message handling patterns).
- `docs/explainers/core/adaptive/...` — the responsive + adaptive UI system contract, guide, and API reference.
- `docs/explainers/core/theme/...` — theme deep dives (colors, typography, tokens).
