4) `color_system_under_the_hood.md` — pipeline, derivation, and contrast enforcement
5) `color_system_review.md` — rationale, guardrails, and extension rules
6) `typography_system_review.md` — current state, gaps, and simplification plan
7) `typography_system_proposal.md` — target architecture + governance
