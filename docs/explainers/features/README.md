# Feature Explainers

Put feature-specific “how it works” docs here.

Example:

- `docs/explainers/features/flashcards/animation_pipeline.md`

Current:

- `docs/explainers/features/user/profile_draft.md` — client-only persistence for the Complete Profile form.
- `docs/explainers/features/user/profile_image_upload.md` — presigned profile image upload + render URL flow.
